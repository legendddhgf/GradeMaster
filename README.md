# GradeMaster
A grading system intended to handle making every aspect of grading convenient

## Expected features
* System entirely configurable without recompiling / changing the code
* Easy to use with complete documentation
* Have a remote mode where you can run the system as a server on the system with the files to be graded
and as a remote client on the system where one prefers working.
    * will be looking into daemon() so the server side runs itself as a background process
* TBD
